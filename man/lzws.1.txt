SYNOPSIS
--------
*lzws* ['OPTIONS'] < 'archive.tar' > 'archive.tar.Z'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Lzws is a library with streaming interface for compressor and decompressor.
Default options are fully compatible with original UNIX compress.
It has a cli tool for single file processing.


OPTIONS
-------
*-d, --decompress*::
  Enable decompress mode.
  Default mode is compress.

*-b, --max-code-bit-length=9..16*::
  Set max code bit length.
  Default value is 16.
  It can be used in compress mode only.
  Compressor writes max code bit length value to file.
  Decompressor reads this option from file.

*-m, --msb*::
  Enable most significant bit mode.
  Default mode is least significant bit.
  It should be used in both compress and decompress mode.
  Compressor won't store information about significant bit mode in file.
  Decompressor won't read this option from file.

*-r, --raw*::
  Disable block mode.
  Block mode is enabled by default.
  It can be used in compress mode only.
  Compressor writes max code bit length value to file.
  Decompressor reads this option from file.

*-u, --unaligned-bit-groups*::
  Enable unaligned bit groups.
  Disabled by default.
  It should be used in both compress and decompress mode.
  Compressor won't store information about unaligned bit groups in file.
  Decompressor won't read this option from file.

*-q, --quiet*::

  Print help.


COMPATIBILITY
-------------
Default options are fully compatible with original UNIX compress.
Compressor only options (*-b and -r*) can be changed without loosing compatibility.


EXAMPLES
--------
`lzws < linux.tar > linux.tar.Z`::
  Archive size is about 33% of original tar.

`lzws -u < linux.tar > linux.tar.Zu`::
  Archive without alignment groups is about 12 kb smaller.

`lzws < linux.tar | compress -d | compress | lzws -d > linux.tar.new`::
  New tar will be the same as original one.
