We have created tar archive from directory and want to compress it (create tar.Z).
Let's imagine that first file in tar will be binary image.
LZW compression will not be effective with binary files.
But there are many text files after binary image in tar.
So we can reset dictionary and send clear code after binary file.

Efficiency of compression can be measured as source bytes length / destination bytes length.
This efficiency is known as compression ratio (or just ratio).
This parameter changes during data processing.

Let's consider 3 steps:
1. We read 3 byte and outputs 2 bytes. Ratio is 3/2.
2. We read 2 more bytes and outputs 1 more byte. Ratio is 5/3.
3. We read 1 more bytes and outputs 2 more bytes. Ratio is 6/5.

3/2 < 5/3 > 6/5
You can see that ratio from step 2 is bigger than ratio from step 1.
Ratio from step 3 is lower than ratio from step 2.

Ratio is not a smooth curve, we need more consolidated ratio to make a decision about clear.
Original ncompress uses magic gap of 10000 source bytes between ratio checks.
It uses the following terminology: doing ratio measurement on checkpoints, 10000 source bytes before each checkpoint.
I think this terminology is good.

So we have 2 checkpoints: last and current.
Each checkpoint has ratio.
We need to clear if last ratio is greater than current.

There are 2 problems:
1. On 32 bit system we couldn't count more than 4 GB source bytes length.
2. Division is not accurate.

Lets use simple mathematics.
Let source length = s, destination length = d, new source length - m, new destination length - n.

We want to clear when (s + m) / (d + n) < s / d.
s, m, d, n >= 0.
We don't want to divide by 0 so we need to add special case for d == 0.
So d > 0.

(s + m) / (d + n) - s / d < 0

Let's multiply it by d * (d + n) > 0 (because d > 0 and n >= 0).

s * d + m * d - s * d - s * n < 0
m * d - s * n < 0
m * d < s * n

This formular is much better: we need to process 2 multiplications and compare it.
We can use GMP library for such purpose.
This solution will be accurate and won't limit source length.

PS we shouldn't clear when dictionary is full.
